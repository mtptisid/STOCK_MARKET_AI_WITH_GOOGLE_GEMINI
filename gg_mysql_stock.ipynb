    "# Gemini-Powered SQL Query Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is an intelligent SQL query assistant powered by Google's **Gemini 1.5 Pro** LLM and LangChain. It connects to a MySQL database, generates SQL queries based on natural language input, and retrieves accurate results. The project also includes semantic similarity-based example selection for better query generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gemini LLM Integration**: Leverages Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro for natural language processing.\n",
    "- **Semantic Example Selector**: Enhances prompt quality using Chroma and HuggingFace embeddings.\n",
    "- **Customizable Prompt Templates**: Dynamically selects few-shot examples based on user input.\n",
    "- **Database Connectivity**: Connects to a MySQL database and generates SQL queries.\n",
    "- **LangChain SQL Support**: Uses LangChain's `SQLDatabaseChain` for query execution.\n",
    "- **Caching**: Includes a customizable caching mechanism for query optimization.\n",
